        <h3>Propaganda and Journalism in the Civil War</h3>

        <p>
          The story of the Civil War is as much about the battles that were fought as it is about how those battles were retold after the last shot fired, and for the majority of Americans living in the era, they were retold through newspapers and propaganda pamphlets. These mediums of communication, as a result, form the core of the competing narratives that remain in how the Civil War is taught and understood today, and examining the conditions in which they were written shows how these narratives began. This essay is about these conditions. It intends to elaborate on the social, political, economic, and cultural circumstances surrounding the journalism and propaganda of Civil War era America, and how these circumstances influenced the media that later defined how we understand said era.
        </p>

        <h4>Social</h4>

          <p>
            The most efficient way to describe the social climate of American journalism as the Civil War began was akin to that of a “Wild West”. Specifically, journalism was caught in a turning point between two styles of newspaper, two styles that competed within a new journalistic paradigm. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The first was that of long-standing, subscription-based journals, such as The Chicago Tribune, The Wall Street Journal, or The New York Times. These papers catered to the upper-middle class and upper-class, and their subscription-based model led to a kind of product loyalty, as well as specific political views each paper tended to espouse. Most of these papers were distributed to only one city and its surrounding area, but papers and individual articles would often travel far beyond this range. 
          </p>

          <p>
            The second were the so-called “penny papers”. These newspapers grew as a result of advances in industrial printing-press technology that significantly cheapened the cost of producing an actual paper, to such a degree that a single newspaper could be sold at a profit for a single penny. These papers exploded into prominence in response to this profitability, and catered their news to that of middle and lower class Americans for the first time in the nation's history. Many of them had similarities to the old guard of news printing, being restricted to local areas of distribution and cultivating an audience based on certain political biases, but lack of a subscription based model led to significantly more sensational and pathos-oriented news content. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Propaganda found its way into both of these ways in myriad ways, as satirical cartoons, as reprints of pamphlets distributed to Confederate and Union soldiers alike, and as stories recounting the letters and retellings of said soldiers, retellings that were often embellished and misremembered. The result was journalism that often relied on propaganda as its primary source of news, and blurred the line between factual reporting and political messaging.
          </p>

          <p>It is worth noting the demographics of the journalists themselves were overwhelmingly white and male due to various factors. Despite the lower cost, the capital needed to establish a press still made it out of reach for minority groups that faced significant economic disenfranchisement. The danger of the job for frontline reporters was extreme, often comparable to that of the actual soldiery, and this danger was far more pronounced for black Americans - especially those previously enslaved - and women. The actual articles were also often published under pen names, as especially in Confederate areas those marginalized would need protection in anonymity, meaning their true identity would go unrecorded. Regardless, at least 3 women and 1 black man were confirmed to be reporters, but this is a very small portion of the approximately 500 journalists that made up the entire industry.
          </p>

        <h4>Political</h4>

          <p>The politics of newspapers was the politics of the truth, and as a result, occupied the same space as politics surrounding the actual government. Long before the first actual fighting of the civil war, newspapers on either side of the political line had been in a war of words, in one of the most polarizing political climates in the nation’s history. The newspapers themselves reflected this political climate as much as they fed into it, as individual papers became central political voices. Both styles of newspaper interacted with politics in differing ways, however. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Editors of long-form, subscription-style papers were often political figures in and of themselves, with editors such as Horace Greeley being so prominent as to be a specific target for hatred by Confederates throughout the war, alongside journalists that reported for Greeley’s Chicago Tribune. Greeley’s support for Abraham Lincoln was a critical part of his rise from the Illinois State Legislator to the presidency, and his temporary withdrawal of support was considered a serious threat to Lincoln’s bid. Other editors were often politicians themselves, and would use their newspaper as a method of support for their political campaigns.

          </p>

          <p>
            The penny-papers often lacked the long-term established political capital of the old style, and instead had effect due to sheer volume. Almost every American had access to at least one of these publications, and the political understandings of the time were dominated by how these papers chose to present their stories. </p>
          </p>

          <p>The only form of publication that could be considered as purely “factual” were the reports of the Union and Confederate armies distributed along their telegram networks, reported by the Associated Press and Confederate Press network, respectively. Both of these lines still often distributed propaganda as often as battle reports, and the actual casualty contents were often very difficult to individually identify due to the terrible conditions of the war.
          </p>

        <h4>Economic</h4>

          <p>The turning point of journalism was as much about the technology that enabled it as it was the underlying economic forces that made this technology so impactful. The rise of the penny papers opened up a newspaper market that specifically advertised to the middle and lower class, and relied on individual sales rather than subscriptions. This increased focus on sales also impacted old style newspapers as well, with various editors being pulled between articles in support of their political careers and stories that would be more appealing to a larger audience. 
          </p>

          <p>The actual wartime footing both economies found themselves on didn’t actually impact the economic viability of most papers, due to the relative cheapness of production. However, certain economic factors did severely impact the news content that could be provided, as the cost of acquiring the telegram bulletins of the Associated Press meant many papers would have to editorialize, or simply not report on the military bulletins at all. The Confederate papers suffered from this most especially, as the national telegram network lines were cut along the battle lines and the Confederacy had to attempt to rebuild an independent network of their own, one that could never reach the size and scale of the union network. 

          </p>

        <h4>Cultural</h4>

          <p>Newspapers were regarded as a kind of “staple food” of the American diet at the time. They were omnipresent at dinner tables, workplaces, markets, bars and third places, and the touchstone most citizens understood the world by, as their relative cheapness insured almost anyone of any class could afford at least one newspaper each week. 
            The newspaper one was subscribed to or most preferred often was considered a personal declaration of their political beliefs, as most papers were open about their political goals, especially about whether or not they were abolitionist or pro-slavery. 
            </p>

        <h4>Conclusion</h4>

          <p>The journalistic world of the Civil War was in many ways a reflection of the era - a chaotic, divided, violent and polarized era. When looking back at the historical narratives of the war, and the sheer degree of historical inaccuracy, misinformation, and outright propaganda that would become established as supposed fact goes to show the sheer degree of manipulation of the truth that occurred in recountings of the war at the time, manipulation that would go on to influence how we see the war today.
